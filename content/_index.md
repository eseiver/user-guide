## Welcome documentarians

We're glad you are here. Excellent documentation empowers users and contributors.

### Contributing content

When adding information to the contents directory, the contents directory should
include:

* Markdown files
* Notebooks!

üìù Keep your filenames lowercase please due to case sensitivity on some systems.

It's ok if we're not sure of the organization at first. We want to get started on writing together first and foremost. If you are doing an example with multiple files, please make a folder.
