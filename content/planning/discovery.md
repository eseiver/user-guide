## What is Discovery?

How do we efficiently find notebooks that have been shared by a user. 

## Why is Discovery important?

To avoid reinventing the wheel, we want end users to be able to find notebooks
that have been done by others.

## How might Discovery work

When a notebook is shared, it is stored and indexed.

Elasticsearch can be used for the indexing and search.

GraphQL and React can be used for the Front End.
