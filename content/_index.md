## Welcome documentarians

We're glad you are here. Excellent documentation empowers users and contributors.

### Contributing content

When adding information to the contents directory, the contents directory should
include:

* Markdown files
* Notebooks!

üìù Keep your filenames lowercase please due to case sensitivity on some systems.

It's ok if we're not sure of the organization at first. We want to get started on writing together first and foremost. If you are doing an example with multiple files, please make a folder.

### Building docs locally

Initially, we will be using Hugo and its docdock theme as a git submodule.

1. On a Mac, you can `brew install hugo`. On other systems, please follow the
hugo installation steps.

2. Get the documentation source or update the source.

3. From the root of the repo, type `hugo server` to build and serve the docs
   locally

4. Navigate to `localhost:1313`
